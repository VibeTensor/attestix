As AI agents proliferate across enterprise workflows, a fundamental question emerges: how do you know which agent did what, and whether it was authorized to do so?

## The Trust Gap

Today's AI agents operate in a trust vacuum. They have no verifiable identity, no way to prove their capabilities, and no cryptographic trail of their actions. This creates real problems:

- **No accountability** when agents make decisions or access sensitive data
- **No compliance** evidence for regulators like the EU AI Act
- **No interoperability** between agent frameworks (MCP, A2A, custom)

## What Attestation Provides

Attestation infrastructure gives every AI agent a cryptographic identity and a verifiable record of its actions. Think of it as the passport system for AI agents:

1. **Identity** - Each agent gets a unique identifier (UAIT) backed by Ed25519 keys
2. **Credentials** - W3C Verifiable Credentials prove capabilities and compliance status
3. **Delegation** - UCAN tokens enable scoped, revocable permission chains
4. **Audit Trail** - Hash-chained provenance records create tamper-evident logs

## Why Now

The EU AI Act enforcement date of August 2, 2026 creates an immediate need for machine-readable compliance declarations. Manual compliance tools generate PDFs and reports. Attestix generates cryptographically signed, independently verifiable proofs.

The gap between "AI safety theater" and "provable AI compliance" is the gap that attestation infrastructure fills.
