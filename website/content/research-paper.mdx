We have published a research paper describing the Attestix architecture and its approach to solving the AI agent trust problem.

## Abstract

As AI agents proliferate across enterprise workflows, the need for verifiable identity, auditable actions, and regulatory compliance becomes critical. Attestix presents a comprehensive attestation infrastructure that provides cryptographic identity, W3C Verifiable Credentials, capability-based delegation, and EU AI Act compliance tooling through a 47-tool MCP server.

## Key Contributions

1. **Universal Agent Identity Token (UAIT)** - A bridge format connecting MCP server names, A2A agent cards, and W3C DIDs into a single identity namespace

2. **Ed25519Signature2020 Credentials** - Full W3C Verifiable Credentials implementation with JSON-LD context and revocation support

3. **UCAN Delegation Chains** - Capability-based delegation using signed JWT tokens with scoped permissions and time bounds

4. **EU AI Act Conformity Declarations** - Machine-readable Annex V declarations that can be cryptographically signed and blockchain-anchored

5. **91 Conformance Benchmarks** - Test suite validating compliance with W3C, IETF, and UCAN specifications
