Attestix runs as an MCP server, which means any MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) can use all 47 tools out of the box. Here is how to get started.

## Step 1: Install

```bash
pip install attestix
```

## Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client

Add Attestix to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "attestix": {
      "command": "attestix",
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Create an Agent Identity

Ask your AI agent to create an identity:

> "Create an agent identity for my compliance auditor agent"

The agent will call `create_agent_identity` and return a UAIT, DID, and Ed25519 key pair.

## Step 4: Issue a Credential

> "Issue a verifiable credential for this agent with type ComplianceDeclaration"

This calls `issue_credential` with Ed25519Signature2020 signing, producing a W3C Verifiable Credential. Note: this generates a signed declaration, not a regulatory compliance certification.

## Step 5: Anchor to Blockchain

> "Anchor this credential to Base L2"

This calls `anchor_credential` to create an Ethereum Attestation Service record on Base L2.

That is it. Five steps, five minutes, and your AI agent now has verifiable identity and signed credentials. These are cryptographic artifacts for documentation purposes, not regulatory certifications.
